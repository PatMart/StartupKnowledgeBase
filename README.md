## About

### Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


### Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of starting successful startups.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight(s) gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope using criteria that maximize the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors and ideas that have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and ideas become outdated. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of startups.

- Breadth. A quality selection of valuable articles across a broad array of startup topics.


### Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition, a company that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is broadly divided into three categories: business, development, and personal.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success" or "building value for customers/users." Topics include founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, management, etc.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product." Topics include computer science, software development, system architecture, system/database administration, UX, design, etc.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups. Topics include personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, introspection, etc.


### Structure

Articles are divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are divided into various subcategories.


## Criteria

An article will be considered for inclusion if it offers some piece of valuable insight on a topic, with priority given to important articles by authors with demonstrated success in their field.

## The Collection

### Business: Advice & Mentorship

**[Should Your Startup Have an Advisory Board?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/10/12/should-your-startup-have-an-advisory-board/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-10-12

> Many first-time entrepreneurs form advisory boards and grant 0.25-0.5% equity to each adviser.  Should you?  This post talks about why equity for advisers should only come if they write a check and if you do set up an advisory board what the best way to run it is.  Also a quick note on how VCs view advisory boards (summary answer is – we’re cynical).

### Business: Budgeting & Finances

**[Budgeting In A Large Company](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-large-company.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2013-10-02

> The budgeting process is really critical in a large company. It forces the company to make highly informed decisions about investments and resource allocation and it creates company wide discipline around hitting goals. I have never seen a company of 150 employees or more operate functionally without a strong budget process.

**[How Much To Burn While Building Product](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/how-much-to-burn-while-building-product.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-12-19

>  

**[Burn Rates: How Much?](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-12-12

>  

**[Burn Rate](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rate.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-12-05

> Your burn rate is the speed at which your cash balance is going down. If you had $1mm in cash on January 1st, and now it is October 1st and you have $250,000 left, your burn rate is $750,000/9, or $83,333/month.

**[Margins (continued)](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/margins-continued.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-04-18

> I like to focus on "gross margin" because I think it tells you a lot about the scalability of a business (as I detailed in last week's post). But operating margin which is gross margin less all the operating costs is another really important metric.

**[Budgeting In A Growing Company](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-growing-company.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-05-24

> What happens to the budgeting process once revenues start coming in, headcount gets to between 50 and 100 employees, and you are now a full fledged high growth business?

**[Budgeting In A Small Early Stage Company](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-small-early-stage-company.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-05-10

> The first step in budgeting is to review the key business metrics and lock them down based on what is realistic for the next year. Be very realistic. A good budget is a conservative budget.

### Business: Culture & Values

**[Culture Code - Asana](http://www.slideshare.net/asana/culture-code-asana-29674527)**<br/>
Asana - slideshare.net - 2014-01-03

> Asana is a group of peers on a bold mission: to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. Learn more about Asana's culture: - How shared core values impact decision making and culture, - How we hire extraordinary people, - How we stay healthy & happy in the office, - How we get things done through Episodes, special weeks, hackathons, and using our product.

**[Nonviolent Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)**<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg - en.wikipedia.org

> Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

### Business: Customers

**[What is customer development?](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html)**<br/>
Eric Ries - startuplessonslearned.com

> 

### Business: Early Stage

**[Product > Strategy > Business Model](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/product-strategy-business-model.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-06-02

> Getting product right means finding product market fit. It does not mean launching the product. It means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it. That means different things in consumer, saas, infrastructure, hardware, etc, but in every case you must get to product market fit before thinking about anything else. And, I believe, moving to business model before finding product market fit can be the worst thing for your business.

**[Corporate Entities](http://www.avc.com/2010/02/corporate-entity/)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-02-22

> There are many people who run a business and don't incorporate. A good example of this are many of the sellers on Etsy. They make things, sell them, receive the income, and pay the taxes as part of their personal returns. But there are three big reasons you'll want to consider incorporating; liability, taxes, and investment. And the kind of corporate entity you create depends on where you want to come out on all three of those factors.

**[How to Bring a Product to Market, Part 2 — After Product/Market Fit](http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview-2)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2010-01-12

> Here, Sean Ellis explains what you do after fit: optimizing your positioning, implementing a business model, and optimizing your funnel — all so you’re prepared to acquire users quickly and profitably.

**[How to Bring a Product to Market / A Very Rare Interview with Sean Ellis - by Babak Nivi](http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2009-12-14

> In an early stage startup you have an opportunity to put a product out there, get that initial user feedback, and then you have two choices. If that feedback is really strong and the users say that they’d be very disappointed without it, in a large percentage, then you can try to grow the business. Alternatively, if they come back and say that they wouldn’t be that disappointed without the product, then you have the choices where you can either try to grow it or you can decide that you’re not going to try and grow the business. And to me, my recommendation has always been to decide not to grow the business if it doesn’t have a lot of people that are real passionate about the solutions.

**[Most Common Early Start-up Mistakes](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/08/17/most-common-early-start-up-mistakes/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-08-17

> I often talk with entrepreneurs who are kicking around their next idea.  Sometimes they’re working full time at a company or sometimes they’ve already left their employer and they’re bouncing around ideas with friends.  These periods of time can leave a founder very vulnerable in the future.

**[Minimum Viable Product: a guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html)**<br/>
Eric Ries - startuplessonslearned.com

### Business: Entrepreneurship

**[What Makes an Entrepreneur? Four Letters: JFDI](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/19/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-four-lettersjfdi/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-11-19

> I believe that being successful as an entrepreneur requires you to get lots of things done.  You are constantly faced with decisions and there is always incomplete information.  This paralyzes most people.  Not you. Entrepreneurs make fast decisions and move forward knowing that at best 70% of their decisions are going to be right.  They move the ball forward every day.  They are quick to spot their mistakes and correct.  Good entrepreneurs can admit when their course of action was wrong and learn from it.  Good entrepreneurs are wrong often.  If you’re not then you’re not trying hard enough.  Good entrepreneurs have a penchant for doing vs. over-analyzing.  (obviously don’t read this as zero analysis).

### Business: Feedback

**[What Not to Ask](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/what-not-to-ask)**<br/>
Paul Smith - robots.thoughtbot.com - 2014-07-10

> Let’s go over some common pitfalls and how to avoid them. In the process we’ll figure out what kind of questions will help us identify the information we need [from user interviews], while avoiding questions that lead to inaccurate responses.

### Business: Founding

**[Developing New Startup Ideas](http://cdixon.org/2010/03/14/developing-new-startup-ideas/)**<br/>
Chris Dixon - cdixon.org - 2010-03-14

> If you want to start a company and are working on new ideas, here’s how I’ve always done it and how I recommend you do it.  Be the opposite of secretive. 

**[Dividing Equity Between Founders](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/23/dividing-equity-between-founders/)**<br/>
Chris Dixon - cdixon.org - 2009-08-23

> I can’t tell you how many companies I’ve seen where a random former founder who was long gone owned some big chunk of the company.

**[First Round Funding Terms and Founder Vesting](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/08/17/first-round-funding-terms-and-founder-vesting/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-08-17

> I’m putting millions of dollars in your company.  My thesis is YOU.   I need some protection that you’re not fully or mostly vested where you could simply walk away with a large stake in the company, screwing not just me but the entire employee base of the company.  I’m not Sequoia.  I’m not looking to bring in a new team to replace you.  If you leave my thesis is largely out the door.

**[Founder Vesting](http://cdixon.org/2009/04/21/founder-vesting/)**<br/>
Chris Dixon - cdixon.org - 2009-04-21

> The most important term in a startup term sheet that no one seems to think carefully about is founder vesting. There are two key points about vesting: 1) All startup employees – including founders! – should vest over 4 years from their start date (with a one year “cliff”). 2) Founders should always have acceleration on change of control!

**[Founders, Ownership and Prenuptials](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/08/18/founders-ownership-and-stock-options/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-04-18

> Best case scenario in my mind is just 1, but at most I recommend 2. I knew this topic would be controversial because when I tell people this in person it always elicits shock.   To be clear – it is not about being stingy with or hoarding equity – it is about having a prenuptial agreement.

### Business: Fundraising

**[The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches](http://tomtunguz.com/inevitability/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2014-08-01

> The most successful pitches argue the market will unfold inexorably in the way the founders envision on a relevant time scale. And, that this startup in particular will dominate share in that new world. ... There is no prescriptive way I can recommend to consistently argue inevitability. Some founders use data. Others use logic. Still others use emotion and passion to do it. But in the end, these exceptional storytellers make you want to believe, suspend doubt, and disregard the great risks that all startups face all along their journey, and get involved with the business.

**[How to Raise Money](http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html)**<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2013-09-01

> Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you., "Be in fundraising mode or not.", "Get introductions to investors.", "Hear no till you hear yes.", "Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.", "Know where you stand.", "Get the first commitment.", "Close committed money.", "Avoid investors who don't 'lead.'", "Have multiple plans.", "Underestimate how much you want.", "Be profitable if you can.", "Don't optimize for valuation.", "Yes/no before valuation.", "Beware 'valuation sensitive' investors.", "Accept offers greedily.", "Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.", "Have one person handle fundraising.", "You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.", "Stop fundraising when it stops working.", "Don't get addicted to fundraising.", "Don't raise too much.", "Be nice.", "The bar will be higher next time.", "Don't make things complicated."

**[How to Convince Investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html)**<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2013-08-01

> So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable: Make something worth investing in. Understand why it's worth investing in. Explain that clearly to investors. If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it.

**[The 7 Questions A Startup Should Answer In Their Fund Raising Pitch](http://tomtunguz.com/pitch-deck/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2013-03-29

[Market size] Can the market enable or bear a $100M revenue Alternatively, is this product in a quickly growing market or riding a disruptive wave?

**[Trends in Pricing and Duration](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/trends-in-pricing-and-duration)**<br/>
Fred Benenson, Yancey Strickler - kickstarter.com - 2010-09-22

> In the post Craig sampled other popular projects on Kickstarter, and explained how their choices and outcomes affected the way he constructed his project. Craig also offers some advice on optimal pricing and project length to future project creators. We were intrigued and impressed by Craig’s research and conclusions, and we’ve now compiled data from our entire database to see how it holds up. Let’s dig in.

### Business: General

**[Peter Thiel’s CS183: Startup - Class 9 Notes Essay](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay)**<br/>
Blake Masters - blakemasters.com - 2012-05-04

> The first thing to do is to dispel the belief that the best product always wins. There is a rich history of instances where the best product did not, in fact, win. Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current electrical supply system. It was, for a variety of reasons, technologically better than the direct current system that Thomas Edison developed. Tesla was the better scientist. But Edison was the better businessman, and he went on to start GE. Interestingly, Tesla later developed the idea of radio transmission. But Marconi took it from him and then won the Nobel Prize. Inspiration isn’t all that counts. The best product may not win.

**[What is a startup?](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/06/what-is-startup.html)**<br/>
Eric Ries - startuplessonslearned.com - 2010-06-21

> So let’s begin with a definition of a startup that captures its essential nature, and tries to leave behind the specific associations of the most famous startups. A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

**[Startups in 13 Sentences](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html)**<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2009-02-01

> 1. Pick good cofounders. 2. Launch fast. 3. Let your idea evolve. 4. Understand your users. 5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent. 6. Offer surprisingly good customer service. 7. You make what you measure. 8. Spend little. 9. Get ramen profitable. 10. Avoid distractions. 11. Don't get demoralized. 12. Don't give up. 13. Deals fall through.

### Business: Inspiration

**[Paul Buchheit: The Technology](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.jp/2014/07/the-technology.html)**<br/>
Paul Buchheit - paulbuchheit.blogspot.jp - 2014-07-30

> It's often assumed that business is all about money, but to me that's like saying that rockets are all about rocket fuel. On some level it's true. You won't even make it off the launch pad without fuel. But that myopic view misses out on the larger purpose and mission of the machine. Certainly some businesses really are about nothing more than making money, but among the truly significant founders I've known, there's always a larger purpose. It's not just a nihilistic pursuit of rocket fuel.

### Business: Leadership & Management

**[Asana’s Justin Rosenstein on the One Quality Every Startup Needs to Survive](http://firstround.com/article/Asanas-Justin-Rosenstein-on-the-One-Quality-Every-Startup-Needs-to-Survive)**<br/>
First Round Capital - firstround.com - 2014-01-30

> If people don’t have true clarity around what they're doing and how it fits into their organization, they’re bound to duplicate efforts, deflate morale, spend hours on unimportant tasks, and more. To combat this problem, Rosenstein says, leaders need to prioritize clarity in everything they do in this order: Clarity of purpose; clarity of plan; and clarity of responsibility. If you can marry these three qualities, you can achieve organizational fluidity that will get the most out of your resources.

**[Goldilocks Management](https://medium.com/@moskov/goldilocks-management-c01c6846e06e)**<br/>
Dustin Moskovitz - medium.com - 2013-09-17

> The limits of a completely flat approach, as conceded by Valve, reveal the mental trap that is causing startups to reject management. With the reference to the military at the beginning, Valve makes it clear that they see management solely through the lens of command and control hierarchies: it’s there to establish bureaucracy in the name of consistency and order. This can be true, but need not be, and definitely should not be the only role that management plays. Instead, I think the most important value of a manager is to serve their reports: to unblock them, mentor them, and keep them pointed in a direction that best serves their needs and the priorities of the organization.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-16

> Many founders are naturally talented at building product and building the user base. But building the company comes harder to them. I once discussed this with Roelof Bothaand he made a fantastic suggestion. Founders should think of the business as yet another product they are building. It is the ultimate product they are building because from the company can come any number of additional products and any number of additional initiatives. The company, if built correctly, will be more important than any single product it can create.

> So you've built and launched your product. It is well received. You've acheived "product market fit" and it is time to get more users or customers. You've graduated from the "building product" stage and have entered the "building usage" phase. What does this mean for your team?

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-02

> Building product is not about having a large team to manage. It is about having a small team with the right people on it. You need product, design, and software engineering skills on the team. And you need to be focused, committed, and driven. Management at this point is all about small team dynamics; everyone on board, working together, and getting stuff done. Strong individual contributors are key in this stage. Management skills are not a requirement. In fact they may even be a hindrance.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-03-01

> Forming a company is the best way to "putting a buffer between you and the business." But you can't just pretend to be a business, you have to be a business. "Being a business" means separating your personal and business records, separating your personal and business bank accounts, treating the business as a real entity, having board meetings, taking board minutes, doing major activities via board resolutions, following "due process." If you don't behave as a real business, you could find yourself in a situation where someone, most commonly someone who is suing your business, can come after you (and your business partners) personally. And then you are going to say "but what about the liability limitation the business provides?" It may not be there for you.

**[Corporate Entities](http://www.avc.com/2010/02/corporate-entity/)**<br/>

> There are many people who run a business and don't incorporate. A good example of this are many of the sellers on Etsy. They make things, sell them, receive the income, and pay the taxes as part of their personal returns. But there are three big reasons you'll want to consider incorporating; liability, taxes, and investment. And the kind of corporate entity you create depends on where you want to come out on all three of those factors.

> I know that people have an allergy to lawyers out of fear of being screwed.  Much of this is unfounded – some is not.  If you’re a startup and you don’t have a close relationship with a few law firms you’re really missing one of the most important relationships that any entrepreneur can have. This all got me thinking about a post on how to best work with lawyers.  This is stuff I tell people verbally at least twice / month so I’m glad to finally get it into written format.

**[Lawyers Are Referees, Not Coaches](http://venturehacks.com/articles/referees)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2008-06-12

> Lawyers teach you the rules of the game. But they usually can’t teach you how to play it. Lawyers say whether you can do something, within the confines of the law and your existing contracts. Lawyers will also write the contracts and do the filings. But they usually can’t tell you what to do—that’s what coaches do. A lawyer knows that you’re not breaking any laws or contracts if you give a common board seat to a new CEO. He also knows how to write the contract. But an advisor knows the possible outcomes of that decision.

What Professor Damodaran thinks, or what anyone who is not a buyer or seller of stocks thinks, is fairly immaterial. I am also not out to prove him wrong. I am much more interested in the subject of critical reasoning and predictions, and how certain assumptions can lead to gravely different outcomes. As such, my goal is to offer a plausible argument that the core assumptions used in Damodaran’s analysis may be off by a factor of 25 times, perhaps even more. And I hope the analysis is judged on whether the arguments I make are reasonable and feasible.

You should also keep this point in mind when consuming market size information – the market size numbers you read in the news or market research reports are probably only accurate within 10-20% in many cases.  One of the best ways to ensure that you get at least a sensible result is to triangulate between different approaches: top-down and bottom-up estimates.

The most important factor to increasing growth is not the Viral Coefficient, but the Viral Cycle Time (ct) which should be made as short as possible. This will have a dramatic effect on growth. 3. The second most important area to focus is the Viral Coefficient (K). Anything that you can do to increase the number of invitations sent out, and the conversion rate, will have a significant effect on growth.

> Startups are about growth, and of all the different possible metrics, startups often focus on user growth - if people aren’t using your new product or service in greater and greater numbers, it’s a good sign that you’re not on the right track. And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth. But there’s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).

> The Internet is a data generating machine. According to Eric Schmidt, every two days now we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilization up until  2003. It's also incredibly good at presenting that data, both to humans and machines. So it makes sense that collecting and publishing data is one of the primary business models on the Internet.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2013-01-21

> The thing that all of these forms of transaction processing have in common is the processor handles a transaction that was generated by another product or service and provides some form of completion service and charges a fee for doing so. That could be processing a credit card transaction, handling a banking transaction, shipping something to someone, completing a call originated on another network, or distributing a third party app on an internet or mobile platform.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2013-01-07

> Today, most software is sold in a subscription model. You pay a monthly fee for the right to use the software. If you stop paying the monthly fee, your right to use the software goes away. Maintenance and support is bundled in. The emergence of the subscription model has made the software business better. In the old upfront license fee model, software companies would trade at 2-4x revenues. Now they trade at 6-8x revenues. That reflects the recurring, almost annuity nature of the subscription model.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-12-17

> Commerce represents the largest and most common online revenue model. But it is not an easy one to execute profitably. It lends itself to commoditization and margin compression in most cases and the economies go to scale players like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-12-10

> I would break up advertising into two big buckets; ads that are sold and ads that are bought. The first is a relationship business, requires a direct salesforce or a salesforce that you can tap into, and will bring a higher revenue per impression in most cases. The latter is a data business, automated by machines and software, is a volume game and will bring a lower revenue per impression in most cases. Much of the online advertising market is moving inexorably toward the latter category, for good and bad.

**[Product > Strategy > Business Model](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/product-strategy-business-model.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-06-02

> Getting product right means finding product market fit. It does not mean launching the product. It means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it. That means different things in consumer, saas, infrastructure, hardware, etc, but in every case you must get to product market fit before thinking about anything else. And, I believe, moving to business model before finding product market fit can be the worst thing for your business.

Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2009-12-14

> In an early stage startup you have an opportunity to put a product out there, get that initial user feedback, and then you have two choices. If that feedback is really strong and the users say that they’d be very disappointed without it, in a large percentage, then you can try to grow the business. Alternatively, if they come back and say that they wouldn’t be that disappointed without the product, then you have the choices where you can either try to grow it or you can decide that you’re not going to try and grow the business. And to me, my recommendation has always been to decide not to grow the business if it doesn’t have a lot of people that are real passionate about the solutions.

> While I completely agree that achieving product/market fit is the necessary prerequisite to kicking into growth mode, I believe some level of preliminary landing page and positioning testing is absolutely required towards achieving product/market fit. After our call, I re-read both Steve Blank’s and Sean Ellis’ views on this and think they would agree too. Although I think Steve has a stricter definition of what achieving Product/Market fit looks like than Sean.

Sean Ellis - startup-marketing.com - 2009-07-27

Startups require a solid foundation of product/market fit before progressing up the pyramid and scaling the business.

> My central argument is that if you believe that every startup is an iterative learning process that converges towards product/market fit, then you need extremely high-fidelity signals to tell you if you’re going in the right direction. That means that along with trying to charge people money from early on, which is the highest form of “I love this!” you should give people valves to tell you “I hate this!” so that you can learn more faster.

> I add a customer development specialist when the Validation Step begins, which is the role I fill with startups. I belive eventually many people will specialize in this critical stage.  Without a specialist, startups waste critical time and resources deciding where to execute.

> A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.

### Business: Team & Roles

**[Being A Great CEO](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2013/08/being-a-great-ceo.html)**<br/>
Brad Feld - feld.com - 2013-08-16

> My experience with all of this is that it’s incredibly hard, breaks regularly at different points in the life of a company, and requires a great CEO to continually grow and learn from mistakes, adjust course based on new information, and work diligently at being honest with himself, his team, and his board about what is going on. But, if you get it right, it’s magical.

**[The Management Team - While Building The Business](http://www.avc.com/2012/01/the-management-team-while-building-the-business/)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-16

> Many founders are naturally talented at building product and building the user base. But building the company comes harder to them. I once discussed this with Roelof Bothaand he made a fantastic suggestion. Founders should think of the business as yet another product they are building. It is the ultimate product they are building because from the company can come any number of additional products and any number of additional initiatives. The company, if built correctly, will be more important than any single product it can create. 

**[The Management Team - While Building Usage](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/the-management-team-while-building-usage.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-09

> So you've built and launched your product. It is well received. You've acheived "product market fit" and it is time to get more users or customers. You've graduated from the "building product" stage and have entered the "building usage" phase. What does this mean for your team?

**[The Management Team - While Building Product](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/the-management-team-while-building-product.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-02

> Building product is not about having a large team to manage. It is about having a small team with the right people on it. You need product, design, and software engineering skills on the team. And you need to be focused, committed, and driven. Management at this point is all about small team dynamics; everyone on board, working together, and getting stuff done. Strong individual contributors are key in this stage. Management skills are not a requirement. In fact they may even be a hindrance.

**[VP Engineering vs CTO](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/10/vp-engineering-vs-cto.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-10-31

> When a company has a strong CTO and a strong VP Engineering that trust, respect, and like each other, you have a winning formula. The CTO makes sure the technical approach is correct and the VP Engineering makes sure the team is correct. They are yin and yang.

**[VP Finance vs CFO](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/10/vp-finance-vs-cfo.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-10-24

> I generally encourage companies to wait as long as possible to bring on a CFO. Great CFOs are few and far between. And in order to recruit one of them, you will need an interesting business and a meaty role. VP Finance talent is in larger supply and they can take you very far. Get a VP Finance onboard as soon as you can afford one. They will let you sleep at night. Get a CFO on board when you are ready to take on the world. You can't do that without a strong one at your side.

**[What A Management Team Does](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/02/what-a-management-team-does.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-02-09

> The best management teams create cultures that people enjoy working in. And from that comes great things. I see that every day.

**[What A CEO Does](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/08/what-a-ceo-does.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-08-30

> A CEO does only three things. Sets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders. Recruits, hires, and retains the very best talent for the company. Makes sure there is always enough cash in the bank.

### Business: Teamwork & Communication

**[No Email at AngelList](http://venturehacks.com/articles/no-email-at-angellist)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2013-03-22

> We use very little email at AngelList. Most of our communication happens on Yammer, HipChat, Tracker and face-to-face. This probably gets us a 90% reduction in email. If you’re running your company via email, you’re missing out on newer, more effective communications technologies.

**[1-(wo)man Startups](http://venturehacks.com/articles/1-wo-man-startups)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2013-02-15

> The AngelList team is roughly organized into 1-(wo)man startups. That means we expect you to treat your project like a startup. You come up with the idea, do the design, write the code, release it, market it, support customers, collect external and internal feedback and then get to work on the next version. We also expect you to work directly with our business partners like SecondMarket, VC funds and incubators.

**[Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission](http://venturehacks.com/articles/ask-forgiveness-not-permission)**<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2013-02-11

> AngelList “corporate policy” is that team members should ask forgiveness, not permission. We would rather have someone do something wrong than ask permission to do it. Or better, we would rather have someone do something right and not need permission to do it. This is the most common outcome. We would rather have people ship to production whenever they want, than go through an internal review process. We can fix it on production. We prefer the customer’s review process. And it isn’t too hard to reveal a new feature to a small portion of our users and iterate on it as we expand it to more users.

**[360 Reviews](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/360-reviews.html)**<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-04-07

> I think companies as small as 10 employees can benefit from 360 reviews and I strongly recommend them to our portfolio companies. When I see a CEO or a management team resist the idea of 360 reviews, it can be a red flag to me. I like to think that everyone can and should get feedback on their performance, be open to it, and that they will certainly benefit from it.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2014-07-24

> Capturing pro-rata' is sooooo important in early stage venture. You make 20 investments in a fund. One is going to return the entire fund. Two more are going to return it again. A few more are going to have strong outcomes and return it again. The rest are noise when it comes to fund returns (but you better not treat them like noise).

> Cheap, mobile, social, global, always-on, one-click-purchase = Unprecedented revenue growth + companies staying private longer = More opportunities than ever in history for venture capital firms = Lots of new, non-traditional entrants moving to capture this value = Amazing opportunities + Risks + Uncertainties for the coming decade for entrepreneurs, VCs and LPs.

Steve Denning - forbes.com - 2014-04-04

> With an average of 30 innovations to the website deployed each day, we are looking at innovation on steroids. Each of the changes is small, but a small change can be significant, sometimes adding millions of dollars in sales. Doing all this change in tiny increments at warp speed within the framework of a central strategy enables extremely rapid innovation and learning, as well as much greater facility in spotting and fixing any problems that may emerge.

**[Flipping Out](http://code.flickr.net/2009/12/02/flipping-out/)**<br/>
Ross Harmes - code.flickr.net - 2009-12-02

> Flickr is somewhat unique in that it uses a code repository with no branches; everything is checked into head, and head is pushed to production several times a day. This works well for bug fixes that we want to go out immediately, but presents a problem when we’re working on a new feature that takes several months to complete. How do we solve that problem? With flags and flippers!

**[Continuous Integration: Eliminate blind spots so you can build and deliver software more rapidly](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)**<br/>
Martin Fowler - thoughtworks.com

> Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

### Development: CSS

**[Modular CSS naming conventions](http://thesassway.com/advanced/modular-css-naming-conventions)**<br/>
John W. Long - thesassway.com - 2013-08-31

> So there you have it: a simple set of naming conventions for more modular CSS. Again, for my own method I've borrowed a lot from SMACSS, BEM, and OOCSS. If you're not familiar with any of these approaches they are well worth reading up on. You don't have to do modular CSS the way I do. Some folks prefer to use different types of separators to distiguish between different types of classes. But the core of the approach outlined here is common between the major methodologies.

Jean-Philippe Boily - blog.rainforestqa.com - 2014-06-27

> All developers will at some time or other have to deploy code that changes the structure of a database. You might have downtime during these deploys due to database changes being required by the new code that you just deployed. There are easy ways to work around those downtimes and provide you a real zero downtime deployment process.

**[Fast and Flexible Monitoring with StatsD, Graphite and Librato](http://red-badger.com/blog/2013/11/04/fast-and-flexible-monitoring-with-statsd-graphite-and-librato/)**<br/>
Joe Stanton - red-badger.com - 2013-11-04

> Everyone knows you need data to make decisions. If you’re developing software of any sort, quick access to metrics can enable you to answer important questions like this: Is your app working? If not, which piece of your infrastructure specifically broke? Which areas need performance optimization? Do you need to scale? What was the impact of your recent code deployment? Do your users care? At development time, we can get all of the data we need, we use it for debugging, performance optimization etc. but what good is data if it’s not real-world? Things that should be true in 2013: Pushing your app to production shouldn’t mean a loss of insight. We should be able to measure everything, at all layers of the stack. We should get infrastructure and application monitoring by default. We should be able to visualise that data quickly and easily, so we can use it to solve problems and make informed decisions.

**[How Not To Run An A/B Test](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html)**<br/>
Evan Miller - evanmiller.org - 2010-04-18

> Although they seem powerful and convenient, dashboard views of ongoing A/B experiments invite misuse. Any time they are used in conjunction with a manual or automatic “stopping rule,” the resulting significance tests are simply invalid. Until sequential or Bayesian experiment designs are implemented in software, anyone running web experiments should only run experiments where the sample size has been fixed in advance, and stick to that sample size with near-religious discipline.

**[Tracking Every Release](http://codeascraft.com/2010/12/08/track-every-release/)**<br/>
Mike Brittain - codeascraft.com - 2010-12-08

> Automated tracking of code deploys is essential for teams who practice Continuous Deployment. Monitoring every aspect of your server and network architecture helps detect when something has gone awry. Correlating the times of each and every code deploy helps to quickly identify human-triggered problems and greatly cut down on your time to resolve them.

### Personal: Communication

**[Nonviolent Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)**<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg - en.wikipedia.org

> Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

> When I write a blog post, I tend to write it as the idea forms in my brain. I write the whole thing out. And then I rewrite it. I go over every line and make sure the spelling and grammar are correct, I look at the phrasing. I consider the flow. I read it start to finish at least three or four times. I think about the whole and then each part. And I’ll cut out paragraphs, move things, rewrite parts, and mess with it for almost as long as it took me to write it in the first place.
