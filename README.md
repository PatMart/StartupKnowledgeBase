## About

A curated collection of insightful articles related to startups, as a resource for startup founders and team members.


### Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


### Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of creating and growing successful startups.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope using criteria that maximize the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors who have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and ideas become outdated. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of aspiring startups.

- Breadth. A quality selection of valuable articles across a broad array of startup topics.


### Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition, a company that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is considered to be largely divisible into three categories: business activity, development activity, and personal activity.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success." Topics include founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, and management.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product." Topics include computer science, software development, system architecture, server/DB administration, UX, and design.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups. Topics include personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, and introspection.

- There is of course overlap in areas where these types of activities meet.


### Structure

The collection aims to present a broader array of articles on a given topic that the reader may find useful. Articles are largely divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are further divided into subcategories. Special articles considered to be the best-of-the-best, must-read articles on a given topic are marked as essential (:star2:) and displayed first.


## Criteria

An article will be considered for inclusion if it offers an insightful view on a topic and which view is under-represented or poorly represented by existing articles in the collection.  An article will be considered essential (:star2:) if it offers an important, fundamental insight to a topic and is either widely regarded as a must-read or reasonably thought ought to be.

## The Collection

### Business: Advice & Mentorship

**[Should Your Startup Have an Advisory Board?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/10/12/should-your-startup-have-an-advisory-board/)**<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-10-12

> Many first-time entrepreneurs form advisory boards and grant 0.25-0.5% equity to each adviser.  Should you?  This post talks about why equity for advisers should only come if they write a check and if you do set up an advisory board what the best way to run it is.  Also a quick note on how VCs view advisory boards (summary answer is – we’re cynical).

### Business: Culture & Values

**[Culture Code - Asana](http://www.slideshare.net/asana/culture-code-asana-29674527)**<br/>
Asana - slideshare.net - 2014-01-03

> Asana is a group of peers on a bold mission: to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. Learn more about Asana's culture: - How shared core values impact decision making and culture, - How we hire extraordinary people, - How we stay healthy & happy in the office, - How we get things done through Episodes, special weeks, hackathons, and using our product.

**[Nonviolent Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)**<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg - en.wikipedia.org

> Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

### Business: Feedback

**[What Not to Ask](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/what-not-to-ask)**<br/>
Paul Smith - robots.thoughtbot.com - 2014-07-10

> Let’s go over some common pitfalls and how to avoid them. In the process we’ll figure out what kind of questions will help us identify the information we need [from user interviews], while avoiding questions that lead to inaccurate responses.

### Business: Fundraising

**[How to Raise Money](http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html)** :star2: <br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2013-09-01

> Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you., "Be in fundraising mode or not.", "Get introductions to investors.", "Hear no till you hear yes.", "Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.", "Know where you stand.", "Get the first commitment.", "Close committed money.", "Avoid investors who don't 'lead.'", "Have multiple plans.", "Underestimate how much you want.", "Be profitable if you can.", "Don't optimize for valuation.", "Yes/no before valuation.", "Beware 'valuation sensitive' investors.", "Accept offers greedily.", "Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.", "Have one person handle fundraising.", "You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.", "Stop fundraising when it stops working.", "Don't get addicted to fundraising.", "Don't raise too much.", "Be nice.", "The bar will be higher next time.", "Don't make things complicated."

**[How to Convince Investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html)** :star2: <br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2013-08-01

> So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable: Make something worth investing in. Understand why it's worth investing in. Explain that clearly to investors. If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it.

**[Trends in Pricing and Duration](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/trends-in-pricing-and-duration)** :star2: <br/>
Fred Benenson, Yancey Strickler - kickstarter.com - 2010-09-22

> In the post Craig sampled other popular projects on Kickstarter, and explained how their choices and outcomes affected the way he constructed his project. Craig also offers some advice on optimal pricing and project length to future project creators. We were intrigued and impressed by Craig’s research and conclusions, and we’ve now compiled data from our entire database to see how it holds up. Let’s dig in.

**[The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches](http://tomtunguz.com/inevitability/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2014-08-01

> The most successful pitches argue the market will unfold inexorably in the way the founders envision on a relevant time scale. And, that this startup in particular will dominate share in that new world. ... There is no prescriptive way I can recommend to consistently argue inevitability. Some founders use data. Others use logic. Still others use emotion and passion to do it. But in the end, these exceptional storytellers make you want to believe, suspend doubt, and disregard the great risks that all startups face all along their journey, and get involved with the business.

**[Exploring the Series B Crunch](https://medium.com/@DanielleMorrill/exploring-the-series-b-crunch-3e71ae1fd19)**<br/>
Danielle Morrill - medium.com - 2014-03-31

> In this analysis, I examined firms whose portfolio companies have raised new Series B funding in the past 2 years. I also looked at the full range of Series B candidates within the portfolio (companies who have raised a Series A within the past 2 years), to understand what percentage of Series A bets have progressed to the next round.

**[The 7 Questions A Startup Should Answer In Their Fund Raising Pitch](http://tomtunguz.com/pitch-deck/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2013-03-29

> [Value prop] What is the problem and is it worth solving? Why is now the right time to solve it?  [Team] Does the team have the vision and the wherewithal to build this company?  [Go to market] What is the competitive angle (competitive barrier to entry and/or go-to-market) that will enable this company to succeed where others have tried and failed?  [Sales effectiveness & product validation] Who does the startup sell to? Which customers have used the product and how have they received it? How much is each customer worth?  [Product distribution] How does the company acquire customers cost effectively? What are the unit economics (customer acquisition cost, contribution revenue, and churn rates)?  [Revenue model] Does the company have the revenue model to build a big (>$100M annual revenue) business with good margins (gross ~ 50 to 60% / net ~15 to 25%) under reasonable assumptions?  [Market size] Can the market enable or bear a $100M revenue Alternatively, is this product in a quickly growing market or riding a disruptive wave?

**[The 11 Risks VCs Evaluate](http://tomtunguz.com/the-11-risks-vcs-evaluate/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2013-03-28

> Market timing risk, Business model risk, Market adoption risk, Market size risk, Execution risk, Technology risk, Capitalization structure risk, Platform risk, Venture management risk, Financial ris, Legal risk

**[Kickstartup — Successful fundraising with Kickstarter & the (re)making of Art Space Tokyo](http://craigmod.com/journal/kickstartup/)**<br/>
Craig Mod - craigmod.com - 2010-07-01

> I gathered data for the top 20 to 30 grossing Kickstarter projects as of March 2010. I then mapped out the number of pledges per tier, looking for a balance between number of pledges and overall percentage contribution of funds to my data set. Here is that data with the top five grossing tiers by percentage contribution highlighted in yellow.

### Business: General

**[Peter Thiel’s CS183: Startup - Class 9 Notes Essay](http://blakemasters.com/post/22405055017/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-9-notes-essay)** :star2: <br/>
Blake Masters - blakemasters.com - 2012-05-04

> The first thing to do is to dispel the belief that the best product always wins. There is a rich history of instances where the best product did not, in fact, win. Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current electrical supply system. It was, for a variety of reasons, technologically better than the direct current system that Thomas Edison developed. Tesla was the better scientist. But Edison was the better businessman, and he went on to start GE. Interestingly, Tesla later developed the idea of radio transmission. But Marconi took it from him and then won the Nobel Prize. Inspiration isn’t all that counts. The best product may not win.

**[Startups in 13 Sentences](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html)** :star2: <br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2009-02-01

> 1. Pick good cofounders. 2. Launch fast. 3. Let your idea evolve. 4. Understand your users. 5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent. 6. Offer surprisingly good customer service. 7. You make what you measure. 8. Spend little. 9. Get ramen profitable. 10. Avoid distractions. 11. Don't get demoralized. 12. Don't give up. 13. Deals fall through.

**[Six Principles for Making New Things](http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html)** :star2: <br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2008-02-01

> Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

**[The Pmarca Guide To Startups](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part1.html)** :star2: <br/>
Marc Andreessen - pmarchive.com - 2007-06-18

> In this series of posts I will walk through some of my accumulated knowledge and experience in building high-tech startups.

**[The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn](http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html)** :star2: <br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2006-04-01

> 1. Release Early. 2. Keep Pumping Out Features. 3. Make Users Happy. 4. Fear the Right Things. 5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. 6. There Is Always Room. 7. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.

**[Startup Advice](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/on-entrepeneurship/)** :star2: <br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com

> I think the sign of a good entrepreneur is the ability to spot your mistakes, correct quickly and not repeat the mistakes. I made plenty of mistakes. Below are some of the lessons I learned along the way.

### Business: Inspiration

**[Paul Buchheit: The Technology](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.jp/2014/07/the-technology.html)**<br/>
Paul Buchheit - paulbuchheit.blogspot.jp - 2014-07-30

> It's often assumed that business is all about money, but to me that's like saying that rockets are all about rocket fuel. On some level it's true. You won't even make it off the launch pad without fuel. But that myopic view misses out on the larger purpose and mission of the machine. Certainly some businesses really are about nothing more than making money, but among the truly significant founders I've known, there's always a larger purpose. It's not just a nihilistic pursuit of rocket fuel.

### Business: Leadership & Management

**[How Amazon achieves excellence at scale](http://www.crashdev.com/2013/03/how-amazon-achieves-excellence-at-scale.html)** :star2: <br/>
Chris DeVore - crashdev.com - 2013-03-04

> 1. Customer Obsession, 2. Ownership, 3. Invent and Simplify, 4. Are Right, A Lot, 5. Hire and Develop the Best, 6. Insist on the Highest Standards, 7. Think Big, 8. Bias for Action, 9. Frugality, 10. Vocally Self Critical, 11. Earn Trust of Others, 12. Dive Deep, 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit, 14. Deliver Results

**[LinkedIn Speaker Series: Jeff Weiner, Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQJf7W88HDs)**<br/>
Jeff Weiner, Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha - youtube.com - 2014-06-30

> LinkedIn's co-founder/chairman, Reid Hoffman, has written a new book with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh: The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.

**[Asana’s Justin Rosenstein on the One Quality Every Startup Needs to Survive](http://firstround.com/article/Asanas-Justin-Rosenstein-on-the-One-Quality-Every-Startup-Needs-to-Survive)**<br/>
First Round Capital - firstround.com - 2014-01-30

> If people don’t have true clarity around what they're doing and how it fits into their organization, they’re bound to duplicate efforts, deflate morale, spend hours on unimportant tasks, and more. To combat this problem, Rosenstein says, leaders need to prioritize clarity in everything they do in this order: Clarity of purpose; clarity of plan; and clarity of responsibility. If you can marry these three qualities, you can achieve organizational fluidity that will get the most out of your resources.

**[Goldilocks Management](https://medium.com/@moskov/goldilocks-management-c01c6846e06e)**<br/>
Dustin Moskovitz - medium.com - 2013-09-17

> The limits of a completely flat approach, as conceded by Valve, reveal the mental trap that is causing startups to reject management. With the reference to the military at the beginning, Valve makes it clear that they see management solely through the lens of command and control hierarchies: it’s there to establish bureaucracy in the name of consistency and order. This can be true, but need not be, and definitely should not be the only role that management plays. Instead, I think the most important value of a manager is to serve their reports: to unblock them, mentor them, and keep them pointed in a direction that best serves their needs and the priorities of the organization.

**[Notes on Leadership: Be Like Steve Jobs, ... And Bill Campbell, And Andy Grove](http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/14/notes-on-leadership-jobs-grove-campbel/)**<br/>
Ben Horowitz - techcrunch.com - 2010-03-14

> So what makes people want to follow a leader? We look for 3 key traits: The ability to articulate the vision, The right kind of ambition, The ability to achieve the vision

### Business: Lean Startup

**[Bootstrapping a Lean Startup](http://practicetrumpstheory.com/2010/03/bootstrapping-a-lean-startup/)**<br/>
Ash Maurya - practicetrumpstheory.com - 2010-03-01

> At every stage of the startup, there are a set of actions that are “right” for the startup, in that they maximize return on time, money, and effort. A lean/bootstrapped entrepreneur ignores all else.

### Business: Lessons Learned

**[Building of StackLead](http://buildingof.com/stories/building-of-stacklead.html)**<br/>
Gordon Wintrob - buildingof.com

> We have two key takeaways from our experiences with founding StackLead. First, find other passionate founders to serve as your customers. [...] Second, launch early, but don't optimize early. Our first product was simply copying info we found online about new signups into an email template. Once our first customers validated this problem, we began building a scalable, automated system.

### Business: Market & Research

**[Sunny Whether: Two Types of Forecasting Models for Running Your Startup](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/07/22/sunny-whether-two-types-of-forecasting-models-for-running-your-startup/)**<br/>
Hunter Walk - hunterwalk.com - 2014-07-22

> Well, if you’re pre-product/market fit, over-optimizing for 'hitting your numbers' can be a false positive if it creates an 'up and to the right' graph that actually builds upon the wrong learnings, or masks leaky bucket of customer attrition.

**[How to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber’s Potential Market Size](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/)**<br/>
Bill Gurley - abovethecrowd.com - 2014-07-11

> So here is the objective of this post. It is not my aim to specifically convince anyone that Uber is worth any specific valuation. What Professor Damodaran thinks, or what anyone who is not a buyer or seller of stocks thinks, is fairly immaterial. I am also not out to prove him wrong. I am much more interested in the subject of critical reasoning and predictions, and how certain assumptions can lead to gravely different outcomes. As such, my goal is to offer a plausible argument that the core assumptions used in Damodaran’s analysis may be off by a factor of 25 times, perhaps even more. And I hope the analysis is judged on whether the arguments I make are reasonable and feasible.

**[The Secrets of Market Sizing](http://www.brekiri.com/blog/77/the-secrets-of-market-sizing/)**<br/>
Brekiri - brekiri.com - 2010-02-26

> Like forecasts, market size estimates should most often be considered directional (consulting speak for 'in the right ballpark'). You should also keep this point in mind when consuming market size information – the market size numbers you read in the news or market research reports are probably only accurate within 10-20% in many cases.  One of the best ways to ensure that you get at least a sensible result is to triangulate between different approaches: top-down and bottom-up estimates.

### Business: Metrics & Analytics

**[Startup Metrics for Pirates](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version)** :star2: <br/>
Dave McClure - slideshare.net - 2007-08-08

> This is a 5-step model for creating a metrics framework for your business & customers, and how to apply it to your product & marketing efforts. The pirate" part comes from the 5 steps: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, & Revenue (AARRR!)'"

**[Tom Blomfield ― Customer churn can kill your startup](http://tomblomfield.com/post/81105143223/customer-churn-can-kill-your-startup)**<br/>
Tom Blomfield - tomblomfield.com - 2014-07-10

> Startups are about growth, and of all the different possible metrics, startups often focus on user growth - if people aren’t using your new product or service in greater and greater numbers, it’s a good sign that you’re not on the right track. And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth. But there’s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).

**[Why Everything I Thought I Knew About Churn Is Wrong](http://tomtunguz.com/churn-fallacies/)**<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com - 2014-01-15

> Churn rates and LTV are challenging to predict with accuracy and while rules of thumb like the formulas above may be reasonable guidelines, it's important to be aware of their tendency to overestimate lifetime value [...]. Because a 2x overestimate of customer lifetime can radically change a startup's unit economics, deeply understanding churn behaviors is crucial to making a startup's business model viable.

**[The Lean Analytics Cycle: Metrics > Hypothesis > Experiment > Act](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/lean-analytics-cycle-metrics-hypothesis-experiment-act/)**<br/>
Avinash Kaushik - kaushik.net - 2013-04-08

**[The Dangerous Seduction of the Lifetime Value (LTV) Formula](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/)**<br/>
Bill Gurley - abovethecrowd.com - 2012-09-04

> Some people wield the LTV model as if they were Yoda with a light saber; “Look at this amazing weapon I know how to use!” Unfortunately, it is not that amazing, it’s not that unique to understand, and it is not a weapon, it’s a tool. Companies need a sustainable competitive advantage that is independent of their variable marketing campaigns. You can’t win a fight with a measuring tape.

CB Insights - cbinsights.com - 2014-01-20

> [B]elow is a compilation of 51 startup post-mortems that describe the factors that drove a startup’s demise.  Most of the failures have been told by the company’s founders, but in a few cases, we did find a couple from investors including Roger Ehrenberg (now of IA Ventures) and Bruce Booth (Atlas Venture).

### Business: Planning & Strategy

**[How to Ruin Your Company with One Bad Process](http://www.bhorowitz.com/how_to_ruin_your_company_with_one_bad_process)**<br/>
Ben Horowitz - bhorowitz.com - 2014-07-22

> I am a giant advocate for technical founders running their own companies, but one consistent way that technical founders deeply harm their businesses is by screwing up the budgeting process. Yes, the budgeting process. How ridiculous is that? How does it happen and why is it particularly problematic for engineers?

**[The idea maze](http://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/)**<br/>
Chris Dixon - cdixon.org - 2013-08-04

> But the reality is that ideas do matter, just not in the narrow sense in which startup ideas are popularly defined. Good startup ideas are well developed, multi-year plans that contemplate many possible paths according to how the world changes. Balaji Srinivasan calls this the idea maze

### Business: Product/Market Fit

**[Zero to Product/Market Fit (Presentation)](http://andrewchen.co/2013/10/14/zero-to-productmarket-fit-presentation/)** :star2: <br/>
Andrew Chen - andrewchen.co - 2013-10-14

> A few months ago, I spoke to a group of entrepreneurs at Stanford whose seed stage companies were still struggling to get product/market fit. I wrote down a few thoughts on the topic and turned it into slides. It’s really an extended version of this essay from 2011, but incorporates some newer thinking based on stuff I’ve learned in the meantime.

**[The Startup Pyramid](http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/)** :star2: <br/>
Sean Ellis - startup-marketing.com - 2009-07-27

> Every six months I rethink the optimal startup go to market approach based on new insights gained at recent startups. Lately I’ve been using a pyramid to represent the process I’m using. Startups require a solid foundation of product/market fit before progressing up the pyramid and scaling the business.

**[The Pmarca Guide To Startups, Part 4: The only thing that matters](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)** :star2: <br/>
Marc Andreessen - pmarchive.com - 2007-06-25

> I believe that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts: before product/market fit (call this 'BPMF') and after product/market fit ('APMF'). When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.

**[The First Thing That Matters: Product/Market Fit](http://practicetrumpstheory.com/2009/11/achievingproductmarketfit/)**<br/>
Ash Maurya - practicetrumpstheory.com - 2009-11-01

> While I completely agree that achieving product/market fit is the necessary prerequisite to kicking into growth mode, I believe some level of preliminary landing page and positioning testing is absolutely required towards achieving product/market fit. After our call, I re-read both Steve Blank’s and Sean Ellis’ views on this and think they would agree too.

Andrew Chen - andrewchen.co - 2009-06-15

> My central argument is that if you believe that every startup is an iterative learning process that converges towards product/market fit, then you need extremely high-fidelity signals to tell you if you’re going in the right direction. That means that along with trying to charge people money from early on, which is the highest form of “I love this!” you should give people valves to tell you “I hate this!” so that you can learn more faster.

> In Nick's original article I was quoted as saying that “Hiring is still waterfall in an agile world”. What I meant by that is that a traditional hiring process is slavish in adherence to accepted dogma. A job description is produced, it's disseminated through advertising channels, resultant applications are pushed through a pre-defined process and those lucky enough to have impressed will be hired. In this process, there is no feedback, no learning and no space for creativity...worst of all there is no scope to delight the candidates.""

**[Continuous Integration: Eliminate blind spots so you can build and deliver software more rapidly](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)** :star2: <br/>
Martin Fowler - thoughtworks.com

> Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

Steve Denning - forbes.com - 2014-04-04

> With an average of 30 innovations to the website deployed each day, we are looking at innovation on steroids. Each of the changes is small, but a small change can be significant, sometimes adding millions of dollars in sales.

John W. Long - thesassway.com - 2013-08-31

> So there you have it: a simple set of naming conventions for more modular CSS. Again, for my own method I've borrowed a lot from SMACSS, BEM, and OOCSS. If you're not familiar with any of these approaches they are well worth reading up on. You don't have to do modular CSS the way I do. Some folks prefer to use different types of separators to distiguish between different types of classes. But the core of the approach outlined here is common between the major methodologies.

> All developers will at some time or other have to deploy code that changes the structure of a database.

Joe Stanton - red-badger.com - 2013-11-04

> Everyone knows you need data to make decisions. If you’re developing software of any sort, quick access to metrics can enable you to answer important questions like this: Is your app working? If not, which piece of your infrastructure specifically broke? Which areas need performance optimization? Do you need to scale? What was the impact of your recent code deployment? Do your users care? At development time, we can get all of the data we need, we use it for debugging, performance optimization etc. but what good is data if it’s not real-world? Things that should be true in 2013: Pushing your app to production shouldn’t mean a loss of insight. We should be able to measure everything, at all layers of the stack. We should get infrastructure and application monitoring by default. We should be able to visualise that data quickly and easily, so we can use it to solve problems and make informed decisions.

> Although they seem powerful and convenient, dashboard views of ongoing A/B experiments invite misuse. Any time they are used in conjunction with a manual or automatic “stopping rule,” the resulting significance tests are simply invalid. Until sequential or Bayesian experiment designs are implemented in software, anyone running web experiments should only run experiments where the sample size has been fixed in advance, and stick to that sample size with near-religious discipline.

On the web there are many resources that give complete overview of _what_ you can do with RSpec. But there are fewer resources devoted to how to create a great RSpec test suite. Better Specs tries to fill this gap by collecting most of the best practices" that other developers learn through years of experience."

I go over every line and make sure the spelling and grammar are correct, I look at the phrasing. I consider the flow. I read it start to finish at least three or four times. I think about the whole and then each part. And I’ll cut out paragraphs, move things, rewrite parts, and mess with it for almost as long as it took me to write it in the first place.
