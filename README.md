# About

- What? A curated collection of insightful articles related to startups.
- Why? As a resource for startup founders and team members.
- How? According to the judgement of the curators/maintainers with respect to criteria and guidelines below.


## Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


## Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of creating and growing a successful startup.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope by a criteria that maximizes the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors who have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and so things become outdated fairly quickly. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of aspiring startups.

- Breadth. I couldn't read and catalog every article out there that I'd consider important and relevant to startups, even if I knew where to look. This will require contributions from many people.

- Balance. Where there are different views on a certain topic the collection aims to present more than one view in a balanced way.

I imagine there will be some reactions "Why would you include that article?" or "How could you not include this one?" I've done my best as a single person to collect and organize a broad range of insightful articles into logical categories, but I expect there are a lot of improvements to be made with the help of generous contributors. 


## Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition of a business that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is considered to be largely divisible into two categories: business activity, development activity, and personal activity.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success" including such topics as founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, and management.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product" including such topics as software development, IT, system architecture, server/DB management, UX, and design.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups, including such topics as personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, and introspection.

- There is of course overlap in areas where these types of activities meet.


## Structure

There are two versions of the collection: the general collection and the essential collection. The general collection aims to present a broader array of articles on a given topic that the reader may find useful. The essential collection aims to present only the best-of-the-best, must-read articles on a given topic. Both versions are divided largely divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are further divided into subcategories.

The data is available in csv and json formats for both versions of the collection at all levels of the category tree, as well as human friendly README's generated from the data.


## Criteria

#### General Collection

An article will be considered for inclusion in the general collection if it offers an insightful view on a topic and which view is under-represented or poorly represented by existing articles in the collection.

#### Essential Collection

An article will be considered for inclusion in the essential collection if it offers an important, fundamental insight to a topic and is either widely regarded as a must-read or reasonably thought ought to be.

## Business: Fundraising

### Essential

[Kickstartup — Successful fundraising with Kickstarter & the (re)making of Art Space Tokyo](http://craigmod.com/journal/kickstartup/)<br/>
Craig Mod - craigmod.com

> I gathered data for the top 20 to 30 grossing Kickstarter projects as of March 2010. I then mapped out the number of pledges per tier, looking for a balance between number of pledges and overall percentage contribution of funds to my data set. Here is that data with the top five grossing tiers by percentage contribution highlighted in yellow.

[How to Convince Investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html)<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com

> So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable: Make something worth investing in. Understand why it's worth investing in. Explain that clearly to investors. If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it.

Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com

> "[Value prop] What is the problem and is it worth solving? Why is now the right time to solve it?  [Team] Does the team have the vision and the wherewithal to build this company?  [Go to market] What is the competitive angle (competitive barrier to entry and/or go-to-market) that will enable this company to succeed where others have tried and failed?  [Sales effectiveness & product validation] Who does the startup sell to? Which customers have used the product and how have they received it? How much is each customer worth?  [Product distribution] How does the company acquire customers cost effectively? What are the unit economics (customer acquisition cost, contribution revenue, and churn rates)?  [Revenue model] Does the company have the revenue model to build a big (>$100M annual revenue) business with good margins (gross ~ 50 to 60% / net ~15 to 25%) under reasonable assumptions?  [Market size] Can the market enable or bear a $100M revenue Alternatively, is this product in a quickly growing market or riding a disruptive wave?"

[The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches](http://tomtunguz.com/inevitability/)<br/>
Tomasz Tunguz - tomtunguz.com

> "The most successful pitches argue the market will unfold inexorably in the way the founders envision on a relevant time scale. And, that this startup in particular will dominate share in that new world. ... There is no prescriptive way I can recommend to consistently argue inevitability. Some founders use data. Others use logic. Still others use emotion and passion to do it. But in the end, these exceptional storytellers make you want to believe, suspend doubt, and disregard the great risks that all startups face all along their journey, and get involved with the business."

Blake Masters - blakemasters.com

> The first thing to do is to dispel the belief that the best product always wins. There is a rich history of instances where the best product did not, in fact, win. Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current electrical supply system. It was, for a variety of reasons, technologically better than the direct current system that Thomas Edison developed. Tesla was the better scientist. But Edison was the better businessman, and he went on to start GE. Interestingly, Tesla later developed the idea of radio transmission. But Marconi took it from him and then won the Nobel Prize. Inspiration isn’t all that counts. The best product may not win.

## Business: Growth

### Essential

[Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com

> A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of 'exit.' The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.

> We started A/B testing a new variant on pricing, one that was more complicated and required more work from the user. But, we thought it might be more intuitive as well.

Paul Buchheit - paulbuchheit.blogspot.jp

> It's often assumed that business is all about money, but to me that's like saying that rockets are all about rocket fuel. On some level it's true. You won't even make it off the launch pad without fuel. But that myopic view misses out on the larger purpose and mission of the machine. Certainly some businesses really are about nothing more than making money, but among the truly significant founders I've known, there's always a larger purpose. It's not just a nihilistic pursuit of rocket fuel.

[Goldilocks Management](https://medium.com/@moskov/goldilocks-management-c01c6846e06e)<br/>
Dustin Moskovitz - medium.com

> The limits of a completely flat approach, as conceded by Valve, reveal the mental trap that is causing startups to reject management. With the reference to the military at the beginning, Valve makes it clear that they see management solely through the lens of command and control hierarchies: it’s there to establish bureaucracy in the name of consistency and order. This can be true, but need not be, and definitely should not be the only role that management plays. Instead, I think the most important value of a manager is to serve their reports: to unblock them, mentor them, and keep them pointed in a direction that best serves their needs and the priorities of the organization.

> If people don’t have true clarity around what they're doing and how it fits into their organization, they’re bound to duplicate efforts, deflate morale, spend hours on unimportant tasks, and more. To combat this problem, Rosenstein says, leaders need to prioritize clarity in everything they do in this order: Clarity of purpose; clarity of plan; and clarity of responsibility. If you can marry these three qualities, you can achieve organizational fluidity that will get the most out of your resources.

[The Secrets of Market Sizing](http://www.brekiri.com/blog/77/the-secrets-of-market-sizing/)<br/>
Brekiri - brekiri.com

> Like forecasts, market size estimates should most often be considered directional (consulting speak for 'in the right ballpark'). You should also keep this point in mind when consuming market size information – the market size numbers you read in the news or market research reports are probably only accurate within 10-20% in many cases.  One of the best ways to ensure that you get at least a sensible result is to triangulate between different approaches: top-down and bottom-up estimates.

Bill Gurley - abovethecrowd.com

> So here is the objective of this post. It is not my aim to specifically convince anyone that Uber is worth any specific valuation. What Professor Damodaran thinks, or what anyone who is not a buyer or seller of stocks thinks, is fairly immaterial. I am also not out to prove him wrong. I am much more interested in the subject of critical reasoning and predictions, and how certain assumptions can lead to gravely different outcomes. As such, my goal is to offer a plausible argument that the core assumptions used in Damodaran’s analysis may be off by a factor of 25 times, perhaps even more. And I hope the analysis is judged on whether the arguments I make are reasonable and feasible.

Tom Blomfield - tomblomfield.com

> Startups are about growth, and of all the different possible metrics, startups often focus on user growth - if people aren’t using your new product or service in greater and greater numbers, it’s a good sign that you’re not on the right track. And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth. But there’s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).

Andrew Chen - andrewchen.co

> My central argument is that if you believe that every startup is an iterative learning process that converges towards product/market fit, then you need extremely high-fidelity signals to tell you if you’re going in the right direction. That means that along with trying to charge people money from early on, which is the highest form of “I love this!” you should give people valves to tell you “I hate this!” so that you can learn more faster.

Matt Buckland - linkedin.com

> In Nick's original article I was quoted as saying that “Hiring is still waterfall in an agile world”. What I meant by that is that a traditional hiring process is slavish in adherence to accepted dogma. A job description is produced, it's disseminated through advertising channels, resultant applications are pushed through a pre-defined process and those lucky enough to have impressed will be hired. In this process, there is no feedback, no learning and no space for creativity...worst of all there is no scope to delight the candidates.""

If you're not familiar with any of these approaches they are well worth reading up on. You don't have to do modular CSS the way I do.

Joe Stanton - red-badger.com

> Everyone knows you need data to make decisions. If you’re developing software of any sort, quick access to metrics can enable you to answer important questions like this: Is your app working? If not, which piece of your infrastructure specifically broke? Which areas need performance optimization? Do you need to scale? What was the impact of your recent code deployment? Do your users care? At development time, we can get all of the data we need, we use it for debugging, performance optimization etc. but what good is data if it’s not real-world? Things that should be true in 2013: Pushing your app to production shouldn’t mean a loss of insight. We should be able to measure everything, at all layers of the stack. We should get infrastructure and application monitoring by default. We should be able to visualise that data quickly and easily, so we can use it to solve problems and make informed decisions.

And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth. But there’s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).
