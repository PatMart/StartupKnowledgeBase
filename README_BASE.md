# About

- What? A curated collection of insightful articles related to startups.
- Why? As a resource for startup founders and team members.
- How? According to the judgement of the curators/maintainers with respect to criteria and guidelines below.


## Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


## Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of creating and growing a successful startup.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope by a criteria that maximizes the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors who have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and so things become outdated fairly quickly. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of aspiring startups.

- Breadth. I couldn't read and catalog every article out there that I'd consider important and relevant to startups, even if I knew where to look. This will require contributions from many people.

- Balance. Where there are different views on a certain topic the collection aims to present more than one view in a balanced way.

I imagine there will be some reactions "Why would you include that article?" or "How could you not include this one?" I've done my best as a single person to collect and organize a broad range of insightful articles into logical categories, but I expect there are a lot of improvements to be made with the help of generous contributors. 


## Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition of a company that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is considered to be largely divisible into two categories: business activity, development activity, and personal activity.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success" including such topics as founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, and management.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product" including such topics as software development, IT, system architecture, server/DB management, UX, and design.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups, including such topics as personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, and introspection.

- There is of course overlap in areas where these types of activities meet.


## Structure

There are two versions of the collection: the general collection and the essential collection. The general collection aims to present a broader array of articles on a given topic that the reader may find useful. The essential collection aims to present only the best-of-the-best, must-read articles on a given topic. Both versions are divided largely divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are further divided into subcategories.

The data is available in csv and json formats for both versions of the collection at all levels of the category tree, as well as human friendly README's generated from the data.


## Criteria

#### General Collection

An article will be considered for inclusion in the general collection if it offers an insightful view on a topic and which view is under-represented or poorly represented by existing articles in the collection.

#### Essential Collection

An article will be considered for inclusion in the essential collection if it offers an important, fundamental insight to a topic and is either widely regarded as a must-read or reasonably thought ought to be.
