## About

A curated collection of insightful articles related to startups, as a resource for startup founders and team members.


### Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


### Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of creating and growing successful startups.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope using criteria that maximize the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors who have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and ideas become outdated. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of aspiring startups.

- Breadth. A quality selection of valuable articles across a broad array of startup topics.


### Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition, a company that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is considered to be largely divisible into three categories: business activity, development activity, and personal activity.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success." Topics include founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, and management.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product." Topics include computer science, software development, system architecture, server/DB administration, UX, and design.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups. Topics include personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, and introspection.

- There is of course overlap in areas where these types of activities meet.


### Structure

The collection aims to present a broader array of articles on a given topic that the reader may find useful. Articles are largely divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are further divided into subcategories. Special articles considered to be the best-of-the-best, must-read articles on a given topic are marked as essential (:star2:) and displayed first.


## Criteria

An article will be considered for inclusion if it offers an insightful view on a topic and which view is under-represented or poorly represented by existing articles in the collection.  An article will be considered essential (:star2:) if it offers an important, fundamental insight to a topic and is either widely regarded as a must-read or reasonably thought ought to be.
