## About

### Motivation

I want this information for my own benefit, but I'd also like to share it and I could use help building it too.


### Goals

- Insight. The ultimate goal for this collection is to be a valuable resource for insight and learning about the process of starting successful startups.

- Comprehensibility. Each article should include a well-chosen quote or summary that represents the key insight(s) gained from reading the article.

- Scope. Listing every article related to startups in existence is beyond the scope of this project. The collection should be limited in scope using criteria that maximize the potential for insight. A bias is applied toward authors and ideas that have demonstrated success in their field.

- Relevance. Technology moves fast and ideas become outdated. The data aims to be recent and relevant to majority of startups.

- Breadth. A quality selection of valuable articles across a broad array of startup topics.


### Concepts & Definitions

- Startup. Paul Graham's definition, a company that is designed to grow fast.

- Startup activity is broadly divided into three categories: business, development, and personal.

- Business is crudely defined as "building success" or "building value for customers/users." Topics include founding, fundraising, growth, marketing, management, etc.

- Development is crudely defined as "building product." Topics include computer science, software development, system architecture, system/database administration, UX, design, etc.

- Personal is crudely defined as "building oneself" as a person involved in startups. Topics include personal growth, productivity, motivation, inspiration, philosophy, introspection, etc.


### Structure

Articles are divided into three categories, business, development, and personal. These are divided into various subcategories.


## Criteria

An article will be considered for inclusion if it offers some piece of valuable insight on a topic, with priority given to important articles by authors with demonstrated success in their field.
